# Privacy policy

sing-box and official graphics clients do not collect or share personal data,
and the data generated by the software is always on your device.

## Android

If your configuration contains `wifi_ssid` or `wifi_bssid` routing rules,
sing-box uses the location permission in the background
to get information about the connected Wi-Fi network to make them work.
